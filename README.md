The Sitecore Search project aims to support your federated search strategy and accelerate integration with the Sitecore Search product utilising its built-in functionality and widgets.

This demo project is powered by [Sitecore Search](https://doc.sitecore.com/search) and uses the [Sitecore Search Starter Kit](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Search-JS-SDK-Starter-Kit).

# Functionality
